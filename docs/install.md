# How to install Events
Events is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should :

1. copy the complete /src folder into a newly created /events folder below the /modules folder of your website. 
2. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Events icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon.
3. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
